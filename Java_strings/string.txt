1.Valid Anagram
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a 
different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.



Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"

Output: true


Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"

Output: false


Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4

s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

2.Is String a palindrome?
Implement a function that takes a string S as argument and returns 1 if it is palindrome or 0 otherwise.



Sample Input

abcde

aabaa

Sample Output

0

1

Explanation : 

for test case one, S[3..4] is not mirror image of S[0..1], hence S is not palindrome.

Similarly for test case two, S[3..4] is mirror image of S[0..1], hence S is palindrome

3.Upper to Lower
Given a string s  which contains only lowercase and uppercase English characters,
 your task is to print the string in lowercase.



Example 1.

Input: s = "Coding"

Output: coding


Example 2.

Input: s = "JAvA"

Output: java


Constraints: 0 <= s.length <= 100

4.Largest Frequency character
Implement a function that takes a String a argument and returns the largest 
Frequency character.

Sample Input

abbbccccdd

avddda


Sample Output

c

d

Explanation :

for test case one, c is the largest frequency character,

Similarty for second test case, d is the largest frequency character.

5.All Alphabets present or not ?
Given a string SImplement a function which takes S as argument and
return 1 if S contains all alphabets from a to z otherwise 0.


Sample Input

amnffbcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyxzqq

abcfhedhg

Sample Output

1

0



Explanation : 

for test case one, S contains all characters from a to z.

Similarly for test case two, S does not contains all characters from a to z.
